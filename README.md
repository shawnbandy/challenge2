# challenge2
I started working on this assignment right around the module 1 mini proj
Pretty much built the shell of the website w/o using advanced CSS, as I figured I could format/add that when we learned it in module 2.

Important to notes: 
A. I added the 'my skills' section since I intend to use this landing page for employment purposes, so it's under construction as we learn new things in the class. I don't think it'll be graded(?), but I think I'm at a good point to where I can submit the page as it covers the assignment details
B. The first application image is just a placeholder, but I do intend for it to link to something meaningful in the future


The Goals of the Assignment:
1. Build a portfolio website that includes name, photo, and navigation links to sections
2. Have the nav links UI scroll to corresponding sections
2a. Have the 'my work' navigation link scroll to the 'my work' section
2b. Have the 'my work' section a detailed look at work I've done in the past 
3. First application should be the largest image on page
4. Clicking the links of first application should take the user to that application
5. Make the page mobile friendly//make page responsive 

The Goals were accomplished by:
1. Building a landing page portfolio that included my name, my picture, and multiple sections in the header to give the viewer a TL;DR of the page's topics.
2. Incorporating a nav list on the header that jump to different parts of the page when selected
2a. Succeeded in having the 'my work' nav link scroll to its section 
2b. Applied multiple details of previous work in the 'my work' section to give the viewer an idea of my work history
    **This does not include the steam page or pikachu picture, those will be replaced in the future
3. First application (pikachu) is the largest picture on the page
4. Clicking all images in the 'my work' section directs the user to a new tab that opens up the corresponding website (excluding pikachu)
5. Page was made mobile friendly/responsive by utilizing flexboxes and different CSS properties for smaller screen formatting 
    **some of the CSS is not optimized as I made the page progressively as we were learning from HTML/CSS through Advanced CSS
