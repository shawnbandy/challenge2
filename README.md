# challenge2
I started working on this assignment right around the module 1 mini proj
Pretty much built the shell of the website w/o using advanced CSS, as I figured I could format/add that when we learned it in module 2


The Goals of the Assignment:
1. Build a portfolio website that includes name, photo, and navigation links to sections
2. Have the nav links UI scroll to corresponding sections
2a. Have the 'my work' navigation link scroll to the 'my work' section
2b. Have the 'my work' section a detailed look at work I've done in the past 
3. First application should be the largest image on page
4. Clicking the links of first application should take the user to that application
5. Make the page mobile friendly//make page responsive
